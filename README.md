# Slack-Bot

<a href="http://www.viima.com">Viima </a> is an interactive SaaS tool for open innovation and transparent feedback.

Durng my free time, I developed a Slack Bot for it, based on Node.js and Bokit framework.

This bot works in conjuction with REST API of the Viima's demo solution which is accessible <a href="https://demo.viima.com/test-company/tutorial-board/"> from here. </a> However, they might change this link in future, so I will add some screenshot of how thier solution looks like. 

It shows the aviable ideas, comments in a real time. Followings are screenshots of my bot:



This is Minimum Viable Product and has many opportunities for further development.
