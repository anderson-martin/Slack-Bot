Durng my free time, I developed a Slack Bot for main product of the company Viima Solutions Oy.  This is Minimum Viable Product and has many opportunities for further development.

I have developed this based on Node.js and Bokit framework.

The bot works in conjuction with REST API of the Viima's demo solution which is accessible from the following link:

It shows the aviable ideas, comments in a real time. Followings are screenshots of my bot:
